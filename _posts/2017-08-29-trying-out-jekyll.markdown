When i first learnt Ruby on Rails, I was amazed of how easy it was to get a website up and running. I didn't think it could be any easier, until i read about Jekyll.
I have never hosted a personal website, mostly because I haven't had a need for one. However, I had some spare time this summer and figured that I should make one just to try out Jekyll.

Jekyll is an engine that basically transforms static files (markdown) into webpages. Since there is no database, it is very simple to set up and use. The documentation is good, and there are a lot of customization available if you want to make your blog or website look good - either by picking a [pre-made theme][jekyll-themes] or making one yourself. 

I am using the default theme, [minima][minima], but have decided to change it up a bit. I want the color theme on this website to look a bit like a terminal, and add some layous for my resume and things like that. I plan to make my resume one page with scroll, maybe with some timelines and weird javascript effects. It will probably not be something I send to recruiters, just for fun.
